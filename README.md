### TODO:
- [ ] Must-haves
    - [ ] Train/Validate split
    - [ ] Logging during training
    - [ ] Configure optimizer
    - [ ] LR decay
    - [ ] Handle sample imbalance somehow
- [ ] Improvements
    - [ ] Use ties/both_bad in training
    - [ ] 2-stage training: compute model embeddings based on responses first, then train
- [ ] Trained model analysis
    - [ ] Average scores - use as accuracy during training/validation
    - [ ] Percentage of correct predictions for pairs
- [ ] More simple models
    - [ ] RouteLLM
        - [ ] SW
        - [ ] Matrix Factorization
        - [ ] Bert
        - [ ] LLaMa
    - [ ] Random Forest
    - [ ] LSTM?
    - [ ] Simple transformer
