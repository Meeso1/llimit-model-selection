### TODO:
- [x] Must-haves
    - [x] Train/Validate split
    - [x] Logging during training
    - [x] Configure optimizer
    - [x] LR decay
    - [x] Handle sample imbalance somehow
- [ ] QoL
    - [ ] `save_every` for checkpointing
    - [ ] Improve logging - also in CLI
    - [ ] Incorporate timing data into logging
    - [ ] Allow to pass JSON as stdin for infer
- [ ] Improvements
    - [ ] Use ties/both_bad in training
    - [ ] 2-stage training: compute model embeddings based on responses first, then train
- [ ] Trained model analysis
    - [ ] Average scores - use as accuracy during training/validation
    - [x] Percentage of correct predictions for pairs
- [ ] More simple models
    - [ ] RouteLLM
        - [ ] SW
        - [ ] Matrix Factorization
        - [ ] Bert
        - [ ] LLaMa
